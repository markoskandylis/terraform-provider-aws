```release-note:bug
resource/aws_servicecatalog_provisioned_product: Allow the waiting that comes with updating and deleting to not error due to a `status` of `TAINTED`
```

```release-note:note
resource/aws_servicecatalog_provisioned_product: Previously, this resource would error or hang until timeout and then error, if a stack had a `status` of `TAINTED`. Now, the resource will continue functioning normally if the `status` is `TAINTED`. This is because the stack is in a "stable state" and "ready to perform any operation." However, although "the stack has completed the requested operation," it "is not exactly what was requested." The `status` will reflect `TAINTED` and `status_message` will provide clues as to what happened. See the `aws_servicecatalog_provisioned_product` documentation for more information and ways to use logging with this.
